# ✅ WebAssembly CSP Issue - FIXED!

## 🐛 The Problem

**Error:** `WebAssembly.instantiate(): Refused to compile or instantiate WebAssembly module because neither 'wasm-eval' nor 'unsafe-eval' is an allowed source of script`

**Cause:** Chrome extensions require explicit Content Security Policy (CSP) permission to use WebAssembly.

---

## 🔧 The Fix Applied

### 1. Added Content Security Policy to Manifest

**File:** `src/manifest.json`

**Added:**
```json
"content_security_policy": {
  "extension_pages": "script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval'; object-src 'self'"
}
```

This allows WebAssembly execution in extension pages (popup, offscreen document).

### 2. Fixed Message Handling

**Files Updated:**
- `src/background/background.ts` - Now handles `INIT_MODEL` and `MODEL_PROGRESS` messages
- `src/offscreen/offscreen.ts` - Now handles `INIT_OFFSCREEN` message

### 3. Rebuilt Extension

The extension has been rebuilt with all fixes applied.

## 🚀 What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Reload the Extension

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "WebLLM Doc Chat"
3. Click the **🔄 Reload button**
4. ✅ Done!

### Step 2: Test Again

1. Navigate to any webpage (e.g., Wikipedia)
2. Click the extension icon
3. Watch for model loading progress
4. This time it should work! ✨

## ✅ Expected Behavior Now

### Console Logs (No More Errors!)

**Offscreen Document:**
```
[Offscreen] Offscreen document loaded
[Offscreen] Message handler initialized
[Offscreen] Received message: INIT_MODEL
[Offscreen] Starting engine initialization...
[Offscreen] Loading model: Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-q4f32_1-MLC
[Offscreen] Progress: 0% - Loading...
[Offscreen] Progress: 25% - Downloading model...
[Offscreen] Progress: 50% - Initializing...
[Offscreen] Progress: 100% - Model loaded successfully
[Offscreen] ✓ WebLLM engine initialized successfully
```

**Background Service Worker:**
```
Background service worker initialized
Extension installed/updated: install
Storage initialized with default state
Offscreen document created successfully
```

**Popup:**
```

## 📊 What Changed

| File | Change | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| `manifest.json` | Added CSP for `wasm-unsafe-eval` | Allow WebAssembly compilation |
| `background.ts` | Handle `INIT_MODEL`, `MODEL_PROGRESS` | Prevent "Unknown message" warnings |
| `offscreen.ts` | Handle `INIT_OFFSCREEN` | Prevent "Unknown message" warnings |

## 🧪 Quick Test Checklist

After reloading the extension:

- [ ] No CSP errors in console
- [ ] Model starts downloading (first time)
- [ ] Progress shows 0% → 100%
- [ ] Status changes to "✓ Model ready!"
- [ ] Can send chat messages
- [ ] Receives AI responses

---

## ⏱️ Expected Timeline

**First Time (Model Download):**
- Download: 5-15 minutes (2-4GB)
- Progress updates every few seconds
- Cached after first download

**Subsequent Loads:**
- Model initialization: 20-30 seconds
- No re-download needed

---

## 🐛 If You Still See Issues

### Issue: Extension won't reload
**Solution:** Remove and re-add the extension
1. Remove extension from `chrome://extensions/`
2. Click "Load unpacked"
3. Select `dist` folder again

### Issue: Still getting CSP errors
**Solution:** Hard refresh
1. Close all Chrome windows
2. Reopen Chrome
3. Load extension again

### Issue: Model still won't load
**Check:**
1. Chrome version >= 113
2. WebGPU enabled at `chrome://gpu`
3. 6GB+ free disk space
4. Stable internet connection

## 📝 Technical Details

### What is `wasm-unsafe-eval`?

- **WASM** = WebAssembly (binary format for web apps)
- **unsafe-eval** = Allows runtime compilation
- **Required** for WebLLM to load AI models
- **Safe** in extension context (isolated from web pages)

### Why is this needed?

1. WebLLM uses WebAssembly for performance
2. WebAssembly needs JIT compilation
3. Chrome extensions block JIT by default (security)
4. CSP explicitly allows it for our extension

### Security Implications

✅ **Safe:** CSP only applies to extension pages  
✅ **Safe:** Doesn't affect web page security  
✅ **Safe:** Standard for ML-based extensions  
❌ **Not a security risk:** Extension code is trusted  

---

## ✨ Summary

**Problem:** WebAssembly blocked by Content Security Policy  
**Solution:** Added `wasm-unsafe-eval` to manifest CSP  
**Result:** WebLLM can now load and run AI models  

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED - Ready to test!**

---

## 🎉 Next Steps

1. **Reload** the extension in Chrome
2. **Test** on a Wikipedia page
3. **Enjoy** your working AI chat extension!

**The fix is complete. Just reload and test!** 🚀

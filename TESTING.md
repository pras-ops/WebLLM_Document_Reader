## Performance Testing

### Memory Usage Test

**Steps**:
1. Open Chrome Task Manager (Shift+Esc)
2. Load extension
3. Open popup
4. Chat with several pages
5. Monitor memory

**Expected**:
- Initial: ~100-200MB

- During chat: +500MB peak
- Should not continuously grow

### Speed Test

**Benchmark Questions**:

| Metric | Target | Acceptable | Fail |
|--------|--------|------------|------|
| Model Load (cached) | <30s | <60s | >120s |
| First Response | <15s | <30s | >60s |
| Subsequent Response | <10s | <20s | >45s |

**Steps**:
1. Load model (measure time)
2. Ask first question (measure time)
3. Ask second question (measure time)
4. Compare to targets

## Browser Compatibility

### Chrome Testing

**Versions to Test**:
- Chrome 113 (minimum)
- Chrome 120+ (recommended)
- Chrome Latest

**Steps**:
1. Check `chrome://version`
2. Verify WebGPU at `chrome://gpu`
3. Load extension
4. Run basic tests

### Edge Testing

**Versions to Test**:
- Edge 113+

**Steps**: Same as Chrome

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "WebGPU not available"

**Solution**:
1. Check Chrome version (need 113+)
2. Visit `chrome://gpu`
3. Ensure WebGPU is "Hardware accelerated"
4. If not, try `chrome://flags/#enable-unsafe-webgpu`

### Issue: Model won't download

**Solution**:
1. Check internet connection
2. Check available storage (need 6GB+)
3. Clear browser cache
4. Try different network

### Issue: Popup won't open

**Solution**:
1. Check extension errors at `chrome://extensions/`
2. Reload extension
3. Check browser console for errors

### Issue: No response to questions

**Solution**:
1. Verify model loaded (check status)
2. Check page has content (>100 chars)
3. Look at service worker console for errors
4. Try simpler question

### Issue: Very slow responses

**Solution**:
1. Verify WebGPU enabled (not CPU fallback)
2. Close other tabs (free RAM)
3. Restart browser
4. Check if antivirus is interfering
